It is good to know how fast different functions grow.  Professor Strang puts them in order from slow to fast:  
    logarithm of x    powers of x    exponential of x     x factorial    x to the x power   What is even faster??  
  
And it is good to know how graphs can show the key numbers in the growth rate of a function  
A LOG-LOG graph plots log y against log x   If y = A x^n then log y = log A + n log x == LINE WITH SLOPE n  
  
A SEMILOG graph plots log y against x        If y = A 10^cx then log y = log A + cx == LINE WITH SLOPE c  
You will never see y = 0 on these graphs because log 0 is minus infinity.  But n and c jump out clearly.

Professor Strang's Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available [here](/courses/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/).
